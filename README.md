#  Ride Booking API

##  Project Overview

A role-based ride-booking system backend  built using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT**. The system enables riders to book rides, drivers to accept and complete them, and admins to manage the system securely and efficiently.


This backend API supports three user roles:

- **Riders** can request rides, cancel (within allowed time), and view ride history.
- **Drivers** can accept/reject requests, update ride statuses, toggle availability, and view earnings.
- **Admins** can approve/suspend drivers, block/unblock users, and view all rides and users.
